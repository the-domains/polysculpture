Test 2 post

In order to combat slowing automotive sales in China, Ford has announced today that it's investing $1.8 billion (that's 11.4 billion yuan) to bring a new generation of[smart cars][0]into the country. The money will go toward developing technologies such as smartphone connectivity, self-driving vehicles and enhancing in-car mobile chat functions, which should prove especially useful in China's notoriously congested traffic. Ford has already been investing heavily in the[car tech space stateside][1], so it's looking to transfer some of that knowhow to its Chinese market in order to stand out in the crowded automotive space.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7fb8a834-1f09-46dd-840a-8379b47358cc.jpg)

There's no question that modern teens are more[comfortable with cellphones][2]than earlier generations, but there's now evidence to suggest that some of them are a little_too_comfortable. A[recent study][3]shows that some teen texters exhibit the same compulsive behavior you see from gamblers, including the inability to cut back, sleep loss and lying to cover up habits. For the girls in the study, this frequently translated to poorer grades at school (though they still fared better overall than the boys). The quantity of texts didn't affect the teens so much as their inability to pull away from their devices. Sending just a few messages doesn't matter if your eyes remain glued to the screen, after all.
